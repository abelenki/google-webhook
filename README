What you need before you start

   * A Google Voice account for your gmail account yourname@gmail.com

3. Open app.yaml and change the application name to whatever you want
4. Deploy the Python Application to your GoogleAppEngine account

How Does It Work
================
When you send an SMS message to your Google Voice number, because you configured it to fwd any incoming SMS to your email account, it will trigger an email being send to your email (Duh!).  Your email has been setup to foreward any email it receives from Google Voice (@txt.voice.google.com) to your Google AppEngine Application.  The application (provided) has been setup to accept incoming emails and will POST the content of the email to your RESTful API which you provide in the handle_incoming_email.py script.  You then can do whatever you want in this API with the provided content.
